this is my CareerDevs Trivia capstone project.  
This application makes a call to a Trivia API to access a variety of 
categories to choose from and then another API call to obtain related 
Trivia questions and possible answers.  The user can choose a category 
and then Trivia questions will appear on the screen along with possible answers.  
User will select an answer for each question and application will alert user 
if their answer is correct or to try again.
